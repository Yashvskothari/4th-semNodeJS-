Creating mini projects like a weather app, to-do list, calculator, or rock-paper-scissors game significantly improves understanding of core web concepts. These projects combine HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic. They also introduce event handling, condition checking, and state management. Practicing through projects enhances debugging skills and builds confidence for more advanced full-stack applications.
The backend handles data processing, authentication, and communication with databases. Using Node.js with Express, developers can create RESTful APIs that send and receive JSON data. The frontend fetches this data using fetch() or Axios and displays it dynamically. Understanding HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE is essential for building CRUD applications. Proper backend integration transforms static websites into fully functional web applications.
