Full-stack development refers to the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end parts of a web application. The front-end focuses on what users see and interact with, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end handles server logic, databases, and authentication using tools such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. A full-stack developer understands how the client communicates with the server through APIs and how data flows between them. This holistic understanding allows developers to build complete, scalable applications from scratch.
React is a JavaScript library used for building dynamic user interfaces. Instead of manipulating the DOM directly, React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript, making components reusable and structured. Concepts such as props, state, and hooks help manage dynamic data within applications. React simplifies large-scale application development by promoting component-based architecture.
