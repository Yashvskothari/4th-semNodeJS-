DOM manipulation is a fundamental concept in front-end development. The Document Object Model represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects. Using JavaScript, developers can dynamically modify content, styles, and structure without reloading the page. Methods like getElementById, querySelector, createElement, and event listeners help in creating interactive applications. Mastering DOM manipulation strengthens logic building and prepares developers for frameworks like React.
Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform tasks like API calls or time-based operations without blocking the main thread. Promises provide a structured way to handle asynchronous operations using .then() and .catch() methods. When a promise is resolved, its returned value is passed to the next .then() in the chain. This chaining mechanism helps execute tasks sequentially while maintaining readability. Understanding promises is essential before moving to async/await and backend API integration.
